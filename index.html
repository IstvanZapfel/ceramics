							<p>She stood in the middle of the field. Her yellow dress was slightly touched by dozens of sunflower petals. At sunset she seamed so gentle and harmonic with the flowers surrounded her.

Then she suddenly turned to him, met his admiring sight and smiled at him mysteriously.

							<p>Material: baked clay, paint, glaze, a pinch of romance.</p>
